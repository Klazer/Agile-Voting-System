# Start Directions

To start, Please make sure that you have pulled the correct files from GitHub before attempting to run the application. Once you have successfully pulled all files and confirmed that you have all the files, then you must run the VotingSystem class in src/election/VotingSystem to begin the system process.

# Tests

Our test classes can be found in src/. In order to run the test file, simply run it as the main program. To make sure that the test file compiles and runs correctly, please ensure that you have created a project that contains all the files from GitHub and then run the test file.
